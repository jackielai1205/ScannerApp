		<h1><a href="faq.html">Online 3D Viewer Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>

			Here you can find the frequently asked questions for <a href="../index.html">Online 3D Viewer</a>.
            Click on a question to see the answer. If you can't find your answer here, feel free to

		<h2>Model Loading</h2>

        <h3 class="question">No importable file found - what does that mean?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                It means that none of your files are importable. Online 3D Viewer tries to detect importable files
                by extension. Check if your format in the <a href="index.html#supported_file_formats">supported file formats list</a>, and make sure that you use the
                proper extension.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="question">Failed to load file for import - what does that mean?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                It means that an importable file format is detected, but the website failed to load the file. It usually
                happens when you try to load a model from an external url.
            </p>
            <p>
                To resolve this issue, check if your url works in a browser window.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If it works, it means that your url is ok, but the website can't access it. Usually it's caused by a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</a> policy violation.
                        It means that the server that hosts the model doesn't allow requests from a different origin. To resolve this issue, allow CORS requests on the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it doesn't work, it means that your url is wrong. Fix the url.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="question">Failed to import model - what does that mean?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                It means that an importable file is found, the import process is started, but failed for some reason.
                If the error message doesn't help, <a href="https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer/issues">create an issue on GitHub</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="question">Why does my model works fine locally, but not from an url?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                Usually it's caused by a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</a> policy violation.
                It means that the server that hosts the model doesn't allow requests from a different origin. To resolve this issue, allow CORS requests on the server.
            </p>
        </div>

		<h2>Model Display</h2>

        <h3 class="question">Why is my model completely gray?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                Some file formats are coming with no material information (e.g. stl). These models will be visualized
                with a default gray color. You can easily change this color in the settings panel (<i class="icon icon-settings"></i>) on the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some file formats are coming in multiple files, and material information can be in a separate file
                (e.g. obj files are usually working with mtl files). Check the files panel for any missing files (<i class="icon icon-missing_files"></i>), and if you
                have the file, import it together with the main file.
            </p>
        </div>

		<h2>Model Share</h2>

        <h3 class="question">Why does sharing fail?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
            <p>
                Online 3D Viewer doesn't store models, everything happens in your browser. Sharing possible only if your
                files are coming from an external server. For example you can share a model that is loaded using the
                open url button (<i class="icon icon-open_url"></i>).
            </p>
            <p>
                When you drag and drop a model, or load it using the open button (<i class="icon icon-open"></i>), the model
                is not publicly available, so in this case sharing is not possible.
            </p>
        </div>
