## Project Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to let users create their own 3D objects to be used on the ios application. This project can allow our website not only to provide 3D models to users to play with, but also let users scan their own face/object to 3D model and upload to the website, interact with the website with more interesting aspect. 

## Business Goals 
- To build a 3D scanner app that allows users to scan 3D objects 
- 3D object that scanned can be uploaded to website and display 
- 3D scanner app should be available for different smartphone platforms, such as IOS, Android 
- Optimize the code in order to speed up the website / 3D model loading time
